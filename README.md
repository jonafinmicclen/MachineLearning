# MachineLearning
All of my experimentations with Machine Learning techniques

During my time learning about various machine learning methods i will be implementing as many as i can myself to gain a further understanding of them. I will upload all of the main files of my experiments,
this does not include the useage of them.

Sinusoidal doesn't work as the Loss function is sinusoidal hence many local minima and model rarely converges.
